# DMCA Counter-Notice
If you believe your content on a *LuzFaltex* project or community was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter-notice. If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates legal action against you before then.

The form below includes information that LuzFaltex needs in order to process a counter notice to a DMCA takedown request. Before you begin, please read [LuzFaltex's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notice](../../docs/dmca/counter-notice.md).
