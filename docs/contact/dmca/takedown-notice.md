# DMCA Takedown Notice

If you believe someone is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized way on a *LuzFaltex* project, please fill out the form below to submit a DMCA takedown notice to request that the content be changed or removed. Before you begin, please read [LuzFaltex's DMCA Takedown Policy](../../docs/dmca/takedown-notice.md).

In order to prevent unnecessary processing delays, please note the following before submitting your notice:

- Don't send duplicate notices.
- If you believe multiple files or posts are infringing in the same copyrighted content, include links to those files or repositories in a single notice instead of sending multiple notices.
- Only one point of contact from your organization should submit the notice.
- Our DMCA takedown process is intended only for copyrighted content.
    - If the content you are reporting is in violations of our terms of service, please use the [abuse form](../support.md).
    - If the content violates a trademark you own, please review our [Trademark Policy](../../policies/trademark.md).
