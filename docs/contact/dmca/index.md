# Copyright Claims (DMCA)

**What is the DMCA?**

:   > The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) creates a standardized process for copyright holders to ask *LuzFaltex* to take down infringing content. You can find more information about the DMCA at the [U.S. Copyright Office's official website](http://www.copyright.gov/){ target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" }. For more information about how *LuzFaltex* handles DMCA requests, please read our [DMCA takedown policy](../../policies/dmca.md).
