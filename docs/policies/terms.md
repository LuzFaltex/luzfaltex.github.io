# Terms and Conditions of Service

## Preamble

The following Terms and Conditions of Service ("TACOS") govern all use of the LuzFaltex.com website and all content, services, and products provided by LuzFaltex (taken together, the "Communities"). The Communities are offered subject to your acceptance without modification all of the TACOS contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, the [LuzFaltex Privacy Policy](./privacy.md), the [LuzFaltex Code of Conduct](./conduct.md), and the [LuzFaltex Security Vulnerability Reporting](../docs/vulnerabilityReporting.md)) guidelines and all procedures that may be published from time to time on this site or any Community site (collectively, the "Agreements"). The Agreements comprise the entire agreement between you and us relating to Content and your use of the Communities and supersedes any prior or inconsistent agreements. In the event that any part of this agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable. Links to these agreements will be available at the bottom of all pages.

Please read these Agreements carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the Communities and/or uploading or attempting to upload any Content (as defined in [Definitions](#definitions)), you agree to become bound by the Agreements hereafter perpetually and indefinitely, regardless of whether you continue to remain a registered user or not, unless and until terminated, in whole or in part, by LuzFaltex on notice to you. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access any of the Communities. If these TACOS are considered an offer by LuzFaltex, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Communities are available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old, or if younger than 13, with the appropriate permission and consents from your parent or legal guardian.

We may change these TACOS or make new TACOS at any time. Although we will attempt to notify you through reasonable means when the TACOS change, we are under no obligation to do so. The newest TACOS will always be available at our documentation pages under [Terms and Conditions of Service](./terms.md). A history of all of the changes made to these TACOS will be available on GitHub..

Content does not reflect the views of LuzFaltex, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content, nor does LuzFaltex endorse or support any opinions expressed in any Content. In no event shall LuzFaltex have or be construed to have any responsibility or liability for, or in connection with, any Content. See the [User Content Standards](#user-content-standards) section below for more information.

* "Kicking" refers to the abortion of the active connection of the user to a Community without restricting access.
* "Muting" refers to the denial of a user's request to post comments on a temporary basis.

If LuzFaltex receives notice of any claim of infringement that satisfies legal requirements, such as notice and takedown requirements under U.S. Copyright Law (see [Copyright Infringement](#copyright-infringement) below), we may remove Content associated with such claim. LuzFaltex reserves the right to provide information to law enforcement officials, government agencies, and pursuant to judicial or regulatory compulsion, to protect their respective interests, the Communities, or to comply with legal, regulatory, audit, and compliance regulations.
