# About Us

LuzFaltex (ˈluːz ˈfɔl ˈtɛks) is a game design company founded in 2014. We develop open source tooling for game developers and we're in the process of creating our own game platform for collaborative multiplayer immersive sims and RPGs.

## Goals

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-sword-cross:{ .xl .middle } Provide high quality roleplay experiences
- :material-hammer-wrench:{ .xl .middle } Develop tools for those creating roleplaying games, be that a tabletop setting or as a more traditional roleplay environment
- :fontawesome-solid-person-chalkboard:{ .xl .middle } Produce training courses for Dungeon Masters and Community Managers in moderation, lore development, and administration.

## Values

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-robot-off:{ .xl .middle } AI Free

    ---

    We believe that AI has not reached a stage where we can be comfortable using it without infringing upon the rights of others. Until we have such guarantees, all code and content will be created by a real live human.

-   :material-source-repository:{ .xl .middle } Open Source

    ---

    Open source code promotes transparency, responsibility, and accountability. We strive to make all of our code open source or source-available and to adopt monetization models that are fair and equal.

-   :material-source-repository:{ .xl .middle } Community Driven

    ---

    Managing communities and ultimately helping others manage their own communities is our lifeblood. We do our best to ensure everyone has the tools they need to do what they do best.

-   :material-archive-check:{ .xl .middle } Preservation for Posterity

    ---

    We strongly believe that you should be able to keep what you buy. We will plan the entire lifecycle of any games and tools we produce, including what it will look like when we stop supporting the software. Software will be designed from inception to allow for user-based support both during and after the support period. This means that if you buy a game or a tool, you will not be locked out of using the software because of an arbitrary decision by us.

    What do we mean by this?

    - Single player games will ship without DRM, only requiring a Steam or GOG account to access.
    - Multiplayer Online games will require an account to log in and authorize your account. Wherever possible, this access will be federated so you don't rely on us to store your account information.
    - Wherever possible, the code will be open sourced to allow for users to modify and extend support for our software.
      - In the case of actively supported products with a paid license, code may be source-available for those with an active license. This is not the same as open source, but still allows for user contributions, security research (including [Vulnerability Testing]), and preparations by the community for preservation after we can no longer support the game.
