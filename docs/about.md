# About Us

LuzFaltex (ˈluːz ˈfɔl ˈtɛks) is a game design company founded in 2014. We develop open source tooling for game developers and we're in the process of creating our own game platform for collaborative multiplayer immersive sims and RPGs.

## Goals

## Values

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-robot-off:{ .xl .middle } AI Free

    ---

    We believe that AI has not reached a stage where we can be comfortable using it without infringing upon the rights of others. Until we have such guarantees, all code and content will be created by a real live human.

-   :material-source-repository:{ .xl .middle } Open Source

    ---

    Open source code promotes transparency, responsibility, and accountability. We strive to make all of our code open source or source-available and to adopt monetization models that are fair and equal.

-   :material-source-repository:{ .xl .middle } Community Driven

    ---

    Managing communities and ultimately helping others manage their own communities is our lifeblood. We do our best to ensure everyone has the tools they need to do what they do best.
